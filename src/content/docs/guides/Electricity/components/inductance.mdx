## **Definition**

An inductance is a passive linear dipole such that the voltage across its terminals is proportional to the derivative of the current passing through it.

## **Symbol**

import inductance from './inductance.svg'

<div class="supercenter">

</div>


- Inductance $ L $ is measured in [Henry (H)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_(unit))
- Typical range: $ [ 1 \mu \text{H} ; 100 \text{mH} ] $


## **Formula**

import inductance_annotated from './inductance_annotated.svg'

Voltage-Current Relationship

```math
U_{AB}(t) = L \frac{\mathrm{d} i_{AB}(t)}{\mathrm{d} t}
```
