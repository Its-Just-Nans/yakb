SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics (with support for interactivity and animation). SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files, which means they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.

The advantages of using vector graphics like SVG over raster graphics (like JPEG or PNG) include:

- Scalability: SVG images can be scaled to any size without loss of quality, making them ideal for responsive web design.
- Smaller File Size: For images with simple shapes and colors, SVG files are often smaller than their raster counterparts.
- Editability: SVG files can be easily edited with text editors or vector graphic software.

## Write SVG

SVG is a format based on XML, so you can create SVG images using any text editor. Here's a simple example of an SVG file:

```xml
<svg version="1.1" width="300" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="red" />
    <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="80" fill="green" />
    <text x="150" y="125" font-size="60" text-anchor="middle" fill="white">SVG</text>
</svg>
```
