## Unix file permissions

import Chmod from "/components/chmod-selector.js?url";

<script src={Chmod} type="module"></script>

<chmod-selector>
    <noscript>Javascript is disabled, cannot load web-component</noscript>
</chmod-selector>

**Permissions (rwx):**
Add the values per user, group, or other to form the permission digit.
- `r` = read (4)
- `w` = write (2)
- `x` = execute (1).

**Special bits:**
- `setuid` (4) run as file owner
- `setgid` (2) run as group owner
- `sticky` (1) restrict delete to owner (commonly on `/tmp`)
