## Material attack

- Side channel attack (timing attack, power analysis, electromagnetic analysis)
- Intrusive attack (microprobe to record the internal state of the chip)
- Material bug (0-day attack)
- Sying on memory
- Peripheral attack (e.g., USB attack, Thunderbolt, Keyboard, Mouse, Network card chip, battery chip, etc.)
- Attack on optimization (e.g., Spectre and Meltdown)

## OS Security

- rings
- sandbox
- virtual memory
- Users isolation (password, key/chip, iris/fingerprint, etc.)
    - Password attack (e.g., brute-force attack, dictionary attack, rainbow table attack, etc.)
    - Password defense (e.g., salt, key stretching, unique password, etc.)
- DAC (Discretionary Access Control) - permissions
- MAC (Mandatory Access Control) - deny by default authorize on demand - SELinux, AppArmor, etc.

## Software Security

- Buffer overflow attack (e.g., Heartbleed)
- User input attack (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Man-in-the-middle attack (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, etc.)
- Misusage attack (CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Hardcoded password attack
