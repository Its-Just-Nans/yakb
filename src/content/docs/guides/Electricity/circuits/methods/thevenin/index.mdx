## Objective

The objective of the Thévenin theorem is to simplify a complex linear circuit into an equivalent circuit with a single voltage source and resistance in serie, making analysis between two terminals (A and B) easier.

## Statement

Any linear circuit located between points A and B can be modeled by an equivalent generator $ (E_{th}, R_{th}) $, where:
- $ E_{th} $ is the open-circuit voltage between A and B
- $ R_{th} $ is the equivalent resistance seen between A and B when the sources are deactivated

## Example

import thevenin_0 from './thevenin_0.svg'

<div class="supercenter">

</div>


Calculate the Thévenin voltage (the equivalent voltage between the two terminals of the network for which you are finding the Thévenin generator).

import thevenin_1 from './thevenin_1.svg'

<div class="supercenter">
  <Image src={thevenin_1} alt="Thévenin's Theorem - part 2" width={500} />
</div>

```math
E_{th} = \frac{R}{R+R} \cdot E
```
```math
E_{th} = \frac{E}{2}
```

Replace voltage sources with short circuits and current sources with open circuits.
Calculate the Thévenin resistance (the equivalent resistance of the circuit).

import thevenin_2 from './thevenin_2.svg'

<div class="supercenter">
  <Image src={thevenin_2} alt="Thévenin's Theorem - part 3" width={500} />
</div>

```math
R_{th} = \frac{R \cdot R}{R+R}
```
```math
R_{th} = \frac{R \cdot R}{2R}
```
```math
R_{th} = \frac{R}{2}
```

Finally, you can replace the original circuit with the Thévenin equivalent generator, which consists of a voltage source $ E_{th} = \frac{E}{2} $ in series with a resistance $ R_{th} = \frac{R}{2} $.
