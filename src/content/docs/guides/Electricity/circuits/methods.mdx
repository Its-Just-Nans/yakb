## Definition

- A **branch** consists of one or more elements connected in series and carrying the same current.
- A **linear resistor** obeys Ohm's law: the voltage across it is proportional to the current through it.

```math
U = R I
```

- A **branch** consists of a circuit element between two nodes.
- A **node** is the junction of at least three conductors.
- A **mesh** is a set of branches forming a closed circuit.
- A **loop** in a circuit consists of a closed path without passing through the same mesh twice.

  *(See Figure 2, Step 2)*

- In a linear circuit, the values of sources and elements are assumed to be known. The goal is to calculate voltages and currents in the circuit.

## Kirchhoff's Laws

### Node Law (KCL - Kirchhoff's Current Law)

- The sum of currents at a node is zero.

### Mesh Law (KVL - Kirchhoff's Voltage Law)

- The sum of voltage drops around a closed mesh is zero.

```math
\sum_k U_k = 0
```

- Example equation:

```math
E_1 + R_1 I_1 - R_2 I_2 - R_3 I_3 - E_3 = 0
```

### Writing Equations Using Kirchhoff's Laws

- If a circuit has **n** nodes and **b** branches:
  - There are **(n-1)** independent node equations.
  - There are **(b - (n-1))** independent mesh equations.

  *(Example: See Figure 3, Step 2)*

## Node Potential Method

**Objective:** TP n°5 (unspecified)

## Superposition Theorem

### Statement

A linear circuit containing several sources obeys the principle of superposition.
The current or voltage produced by the sources acts independently.

#### Rules for Source Elimination

(Figure 4)

#### Example

(Figure 5)

```math
I = I_{\alpha} + I_{\beta}
```

<Flexed>
<div>

Calculation of $ I_\alpha $ (Figure 6)

```math
I_{\alpha} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times I_1
```

</div>
<div>

Calculation of $ I_\beta $

```math
I_{\beta} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times I_2
```

</div>

</Flexed>

Conclusion for $ I $

```math
I = I_{\alpha} + I_{\beta} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times (I_1 + I_2)
```

## Thévenin's Theorem

### Objective

(Figure 7)

### Statement

Any linear circuit located between points A and B can be modeled by an equivalent generator $ (E_{th}, R_{th}) $, where:
- $ E_{th} $ is the open-circuit voltage between A and B
- $ R_{th} $ is the equivalent resistance seen between A and B when the sources are deactivated

### Example

- Isolate the network (i.e., remove all elements that are not part of the subnetwork for which you want to determine the Thévenin equivalent generator).
- Replace voltage sources with short circuits and current sources with open circuits.
- Calculate the Thévenin resistance (the equivalent resistance of the circuit).
- Reconnect the sources (undo step 2).
- Calculate the Thévenin voltage (the equivalent voltage between the two terminals of the network for which you are finding the Thévenin generator).

(Figure 8 → Figure 9)


## Norton's Theorem

Any subnetwork of a circuit can be replaced by a current source in parallel with a resistor.
