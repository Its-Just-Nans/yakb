The ZIP format is a widely used file compression and archive format that reduces file size while preserving data integrity. It allows multiple files and folders to be bundled into a single archive for easier storage and transfer. ZIP also supports optional encryption and error detection to protect and maintain the contents.

## Zip64

ZIP64 is an extension of the standard ZIP format designed to overcome its size limitations. It allows archives to exceed 4 GB and contain more than 65,535 files, which the original ZIP format cannot handle. ZIP64 maintains compatibility with standard ZIP features while supporting very large files and archives.
