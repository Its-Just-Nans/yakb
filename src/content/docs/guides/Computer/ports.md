## Application Ports

### Difference Between Ports

- **Hardware port**: Refers to the physical interface where a cable must be connected.
- **Software port**: A point of entry for communication using a specific protocol.

The software port is also called an **application port** because it matches a 16-bit coded number (ranging from 1 to 65536) with an application.

### Main Ports

- **Port 21**: FTP protocol – A file transfer protocol.
- **Port 22**: SSH protocol – Used for almost all remote machine connections. It encrypts exchanges to make intercepted information unreadable.
- **Ports 25, 465, 587**: SMTP protocol – A protocol for sending messages.
- **Port 53**: DNS protocol – Matches an IP address with a domain name and vice versa.
- **Port 67 (server), 68 (client)**: DHCP protocol – Automatically assigns an IP address (and associated addressing configurations such as subnet mask and gateway address) to a node on the network that requests it.
