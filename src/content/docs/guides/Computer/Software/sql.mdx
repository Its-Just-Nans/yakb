SQL is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows you to perform various operations such as querying data, inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

## How to use SQL

To use SQL, you typically interact with a database management system (DBMS) such as PostgreSQL, SQLite or MySQL. You can execute SQL commands through command-line interfaces, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), or programmatically using various programming languages. You write SQL statements to perform specific tasks, and the DBMS processes these statements to interact with the database.

## Some SQL Commands

### CREATE Command

- **`CREATE TABLE`**: Define a new table and its columns.
- **`DROP TABLE`**: Remove an existing table from the database.

```sql
-- drop the employees table if it already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;

-- create a table named employees
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

### INSERT Command

- **`INSERT`**: Add new rows to a table.

```sql
-- insert multiple rows into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary, hire_date) VALUES
  ('Alice Smith', 'Engineering', 85000, '2020-01-15'),
  ('Bob Johnson', 'Marketing', 72000, '2019-03-20'),
  ('Carol Williams', 'Engineering', 92000, '2018-11-07'),
  ('Dave Brown', 'Finance', 115000, '2017-05-12'),
  ('Eve Davis', 'Engineering', 110000, '2021-08-30');
```

### SELECT Command

- **`SELECT`**: Retrieve data from the database.

```sql
-- select all columns from the employees table
SELECT
  department,
  COUNT(*) as employee_count,
  ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) as avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

### UPDATE Command

- **`UPDATE`**: Modify the values of existing rows.

```sql
-- give a 10% raise to all employees in the Engineering department
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```

### DELETE Command

- **`DELETE`**: Remove rows from a table.

```sql
-- delete employees hired before 2018
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE hire_date < '2018-01-01';
```

## Aggregate Functions

SQL includes aggregate functions that operate on all the values in a column:

- **`COUNT`**: Counts the number of values.
- **`SUM`**: Calculates the total sum of values.
- **`AVG`**: Computes the average of the values.
- **`MAX`**: Finds the highest value.
- **`MIN`**: Finds the lowest value.

You can use the `DISTINCT` keyword before the argument to exclude duplicate values before applying the function.

## Special Case: `COUNT(*)`

- `COUNT(*)` counts **all rows** in a table, including those with `NULL` values.
- Other forms of `COUNT` (e.g. `COUNT(column_name)`) ignore `NULL` values.
