## Definition

- **Network** A set of sources and dipoles connected together by conductors with zero resistance.
- **Linear network** In a linear network, the voltage across a dipole is either constant or proportional to a current.

```math
U = R I
```

- A **branch** consists of a circuit element between two nodes.
- A **node** is the junction of at least three conductors.
- A **mesh** is a set of branches forming a closed circuit.
- A **loop** in a circuit consists of a closed path without passing through the same mesh twice.

- In a linear circuit, the values of sources and elements are assumed to be known. The goal is to calculate voltages and currents in the circuit.

## Which methods to use

- Then simplify to a 2-mesh circuit
  - Use Kirchhoff's Method

- If it's has multiple mesh circuit:
  - Use Thevenin or Norton to reduce the circuit to a 2-mesh circuit

- If it has multiples sources:
  - Use Superposition


### Thévenin ↔ Norton Equivalence

```math
\begin{cases}
R_{Th} = R_N \\
E_{Th} = R_N \times I_N
\end{cases}
```
