## NATO Phonetic Alphabet

The **NATO Phonetic Alphabet** is a standardized system used to communicate letters and numbers clearly over radio or voice channels. It eliminates confusion between similar-sounding letters (such as "M" and "N" or "B" and "D") by replacing them with distinct, universally recognized words.

**Target ID:** `B5-J92`

**Spoken as:**
* **B – 5:** Bravo Fife
* **Dash:** (Pause)
* **J – 9 – 2:** Juliett Niner Two


## Why Use It?

* **Precision:** Ensures critical data like coordinates or passwords are received 100% accurately.
* **Clarity:** Designed to be understood even through heavy background noise or weak signals.
* **Global Standard:** Used worldwide by aviation, maritime, and emergency services.
