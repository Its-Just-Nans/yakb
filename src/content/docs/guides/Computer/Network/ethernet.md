Ethernet is a widely used networking technology for local area networks (LANs). It defines how devices format and transmit data so that other devices on the same network can recognize, receive, and process it correctly.

## Ethernet Frame Structure

An Ethernet frame is a structured unit of data transmitted over the network. It consists of the following fields:

## MAC Address

A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** uniquely identifies each network interface on a local network.

- **Universal System:** Each interface has a unique MAC address.
- **Structure:** 48 bits divided into two parts:
- **First 24 bits:** Assigned by the IEEE (manufacturer identifier).
- **Last 24 bits:** Chosen by the manufacturer (OUI – Organizationally Unique Identifier).
- **Format:** Hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, e.g., `98:01:A7:90:51:25`.
- **Broadcast Address:** `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` - used to communicate with all devices on the network simultaneously.
