Archiving is a key component of data management. In line with GDPR requirements, organizations must clearly define what data should be archived, the purpose of archiving, and the appropriate retention periods.

## What to Archive

When planning data archiving, it’s essential to use formats designed for long-term preservation.

### PDF Standards for Archiving

Not all PDF files are suitable for archiving. The **PDF/A** format (a specialized version of PDF) was specifically created to ensure long-term readability and compliance with archiving standards.

Different versions of PDF/A (such as PDF/A-1, PDF/A-2, and PDF/A-3) offer varying levels of compatibility and features.
