YakB (or Yak-B) is a knowledge base. For less words and more code - check [golb.n4n5.dev](https://golb.n4n5.dev).

## YakB philosophy

YakB is designed to be a knowledge base, the website itself is not the main product. The main product is the knowledge stored in it inside the files.
YakB website is currently made with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) and the pages are distributed as html pages with minimal javascript.

Since learning is easier while playing, YakB encourages users to interact with the knowledge by providing interactive examples. These examples are build in web-components. The goal of these web-components is to be reusable in other websites, so that the knowledge can be shared more easily for a lambda user or a developper (see also `License`).

## License

The current license of YakB is not yet determined. But the goal is to make it as open as possible. TODO: to be determined between `MIT`, `Apache 2.0`, `CC0` and `CC-BY 4.0`

<Aside type="caution">

We don't suggest using fixed links to YakB, as they may change. (for now, because YakB is still in early development phase - but also because knowledge itself evolves over time). Instead, we suggest linking to the main page [yakb.n4n5.dev](https://yakb.n4n5.dev) and let users search for the knowledge they want.
