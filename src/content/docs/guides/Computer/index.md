## Operating Systems

### BIOS

The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the first operating system that runs when the computer starts up. It allows viewing the characteristics of the components and changing their properties.

### GRUB

GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is the boot system that links the Linux kernel with the operating systems located on the hard drive.
