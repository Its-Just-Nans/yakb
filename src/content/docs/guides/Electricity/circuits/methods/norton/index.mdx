## Objective

The objective of the Norton theorem is to simplify a complex linear circuit into an equivalent circuit consisting of a single current source in parallel with a resistance, making analysis between two terminals (A and B) easier.

## Statement

Any linear circuit located between points A and B can be modeled by an equivalent generator $(I_{N}, R_{N})$, where:

- $I_{N}$ is the short-circuit current between A and B
- $R_{N}$ is the equivalent resistance seen between A and B when the sources are deactivated

## Example

import norton_0 from './norton_0.svg'

<div class="supercenter">
  <Image src={norton_0} alt="Norton's Theorem - part 1" width={500} />
</div>

Determination of $ I_N $ with a short-circuit

import norton_1 from './norton_1.svg'

<div class="supercenter">
  <Image src={norton_1} alt="Norton's Theorem - part 2" width={500} />
</div>


```math
I_{AB} = \frac{E}{R}
```

Determination of $ R_N $ without the sources


import norton_2 from './norton_2.svg'

<div class="supercenter">
  <Image src={norton_2} alt="Norton's Theorem - part 3" width={500} />
</div>


```math
R_N = \frac{R \cdot R}{R + R} = \frac{R \cdot R}{2R} = \frac{R}{2}
```

Finally, you can replace the original circuit with the Th√©venin equivalent generator, which consists of a current source $ I_{N} = \frac{E}{R} $ in series with a resistance $ R_{N} = \frac{R}{2} $.
