## Bit, Symbol and Valence

A **symbol** contains multiple bits. The number of bits per symbol is denoted as `n`.

The number of possible signal states is denoted by `M` - called [valence](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(r%C3%A9seau)) in French.

It is calculated from the valence (number of possible states) as:

$$$
M = 2^n
$$$

## Symbol Rate and Bitrate

The symbol rate is also called **modulation rate**. It is the inverse of the symbol time:

Symbol rate (**in baud**)

$$$
R = \frac{1}{T_s}
$$$

The bitrate is the inverse of the **bit time**:

Bitrate (**in bits/s**)

$$$
R_b = \frac{1}{T_b}
$$$

We can convert between symbol rate and bitrate using valence:

Bitrate from symbol rate and valence (**in bits/s**)

$$$
R_b = R \cdot \log_2(M) = R \cdot n
$$$

## Channel Capacity

### Shannon-Hartley Theorem

The Shannon-Hartley theorem allows us to determine channel capacity:

$$$
C = B \cdot \log_2\left(1 + \frac{S}{N}\right)
$$$

> - `B`: bandwidth in Hz
> - `S/N`: signal-to-noise ratio
> - `(1 + S/N)`: the maximum valence

Noise limits the valence, which in turn limits the channel capacity.

So we have:

$$$
R_b \le C
$$$

> - `C`: the channel capacity

### Nyquist Theorem

Nyquist's theorem defines the minimum required bandwidth for a channel (to avoid intersymbol interference - ISI):

$$$
B \ge R
$$$

> Caption:
>
> - `B`: bandwidth
> - `R`: symbol rate

Since channel bandwidth is limited, symbol time is limited too — so the transmission speed is limited.

### Eye Diagram

The eye diagram is used to detect intersymbol interference (ISI).

To plot it, we take a period (either `T` or `2T`) and overlay the signal on that period.

We can measure the horizontal distance, also called the "eye opening".

## Constellation Diagram

The constellation diagram measures the distance between symbols generated by the IQ modem.

**Gray coding** helps reduce errors by ensuring only one bit changes for each π/2 phase shift.
