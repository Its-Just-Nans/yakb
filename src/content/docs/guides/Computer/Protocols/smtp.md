The SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the protocol to configure when creating and setting up an email management server (sending). Its default port is **25**.

To receive emails on a client (such as Thunderbird or Outlook), the following protocols can be used:

- **IMAP4**: Allows viewing and making changes directly on the mail server from the client. Only message headers are downloaded. Its default port is **143**.
- **POP3**: Downloads a copy of messages to the computer. This allows working without an internet connection, but a connection is needed to sync new messages. It communicates on port **110**.
